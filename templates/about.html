                <p>India is a transit point that connects European and Central Asian countries with East Asia and
                    Australia via the sea route. 7-10 day cruises operate from all major destinations such as Shanghai,
                    Bangkok, Mandalay, Siem Reap, Maldives, Sri Lanka and many more connecting India with the Far
                    East.Kochi, Mumbai, Goa and Mangalore are also the major ports in India handling passenger traffic.
                    Costa Cruise Lines running between Maldives, Sri Lanka and India is a feasible option to reach India
                    by waterways.</p>

                <p>International rail routes in India are limited to only three at present – the Delhi-Atari-Wagah
                    Samjhauta Express, Kolkata-Dhaka Maitree Express and the weekly Jodhpur-Munabo Thar Link Express. It
                    is advisable to look for the latest update on these as operations may sometimes be suspended due to
                    border issues. New train routes that have been approved or are under construction are
                    Tapul/Imphal-Moreh Burma Link to Myanmar, and Jaynagar-Kurtha Rail Line to Nepal. Once the new
                    routes are in place it will be possible to go train hopping up to Thailand and Malaysia.</p>
